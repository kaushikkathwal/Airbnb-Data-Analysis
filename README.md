# Airbnb-Data-Analysis

Objective:

This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends.

Procedure:
1. Established a MongoDB connection, retrieved the Airbnb dataset, and ensured efficient data retrieval for analysis.
2. Cleaned and prepared the dataset, addressing missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions for accurate analysis.
3. Developed a streamlit web application with interactive maps showcasing the distribution of Airbnb listings, allowing users to explore prices, ratings, and other relevant factors.
4. Conducted price analysis and visualization, exploring variations based on location, property type, and seasons using dynamic plots and charts.
5. Analyzed availability patterns across seasons, visualizing occupancy rates and demand fluctuations using suitable visualizations.
6. Investigated location-based insights by extracting and visualizing data for specific regions or neighborhoods.
7. Created interactive visualizations that enable users to filter and drill down into the data.
8. Builded a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau , combining various visualizations to present key insights from the analysis.
